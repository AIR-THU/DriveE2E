## Highlights <a name="high"></a>

- DriveE2E is a simple yet challenging closed-loop evaluation framework, which closely integrates real-world driving scenarios into the CARLA simulator, effectively bridging the gap between simulated and real-world driving environments.

## TODO List <a name="todos"></a>
- [ ] Closed-loop simulator release
- [ ] Base-model configs & checkpoints
- [ ] Benchmark code release
- [ ] Benchmark configs & checkpoints
